            <section>The Wayfinder application allows managers of autistic employees to create task and subtask step cards designed to assist employees progress through workplace activities and to reduce cognitive load. The application features additional pieces of helper functionality intended to address several areas of autistic difference that have the potential to cause impairment in the workplace</section>
