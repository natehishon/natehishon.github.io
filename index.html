                Social Communication is "ability to share — in an appropriate manner — what you feel or want to say, and also to understand and respond to what others are feeling or saying."<br><br>

                Further communication differences including:<br><br>
                Difficulty with figurative language such as idioms, metaphors, similes, and irony.
                Possible tendency to respond to suggestions, directions, or information in a very literal manner <br> <br>
