            </section>
            <section>
                Employment among autistic individuals is an area of noted difficulty with an employment rate well below
                the general population.

            <section>
                According to the Drexel Institute National Autism Indicators Report, only 58% of autistic young adults in the United States ever worked in their early 20s.
            </section>

            <section>By comparison, 99% of young adults with no disabilities worked in their early 20s, and 90% of young adults with other disabilities - emotional disturbance, speech impairment, or other learning impairment - worked in their early 20s

            <section>Barriers attributed to autistic <br>unemployment can include:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulties with communication and social interaction</li>
                    <li>Trouble organizing and completing workplace tasks</li>
                    <li>Obsessive adherence to routine</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                Several studies have concluded that long-term support is necessary to acquire and maintain
                autistic employment.

            <section>
                These long term supports can include access to social workers and job coaches, however these can be costly and time consuming options and may not be sustainable indefinitely.

            <section>A further anticipated user goal is the need feel included and have any differences be embraced.</section>

            <section>A survey conducted by Scott et al. concluded that the majority of autistic employees surveyed felt
                workplace success was dependent on continued and demonstrated employer commitment [10].

            <section>Enabling the prospective autistic employee to succeed but also enhancing general business <br>practices such as
                increased:

            <section>Further manager goals may also include maintaining a neurologically diverse workforce, which has been shown to increase innovative practices in the workplace.</section>

            <section>The term Neurodiversity can be defined as those that have a different way of thinking, and promoting their inclusion can bring different ideas and perspectives to a workplace [11].</section>

            <section>
                Trouble with these areas can become barriers for autistic employees and can make relatively simple

                Communication differences and difficulties are a wide ranging facet of autism.
                <br>
                <br>
                Different individuals have different communication challenges and these differences are amplified by the general complexities of communication. <br><br>[19]
            </section>

            <section>
                Autistic individuals can have challenges with communication in social contexts, such as:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Appropriate use of language in social situations.</li>
                    <li>Correct use of grammar.</li>
                    <li>The tempo and rhythm of speech. (Prosody?)</li>

            </section>


            <section>
                Further areas of communication difficulty can include:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contextual situations and the literal
                        meanings of words.</li>
                    <li>Understanding different points of view</li>
                    <li>Facial expressions, gestures, non verbal communication</li>
                </ul>

            </section>

            <section>
                These challenges can have noted effects on autistic employees in the workplace. A failure to
                understand what a manager or colleague is trying to communicate can lead to misunderstanding
                instructions and directions, especially when they are given verbally. <br><br> [21]—[23]
            </section>

            <section>
                Social anxiety is another potential area of difficulty. It can be defined as “persistent fear about social situations and being around people” which
                can inhibit developing a comfort level with colleagues and superiors. <br><br> [28], [29].

            <section>
                Several pieces of application functionality were designed to act as interventions for
                specific neurological differences that have the potential to cause difficulties in the workplace for
                <br>autistic employees.
            </section>

            <section>Interventions in the context of autism research are defined as “doing something, taking action or using a treatment to try to improve a particular condition or problem”. <br><br> [8]</section>

                    <li>Conceived as an intervention to assist with possible executive function disorder
                        by breaking complex workplace tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces, thus reducing
                        cognitive load [27][37].
                    </li>
                    <li>By following the task steps, the user will be assisted in progressing through a workplace
                        activity one small step at a time [18], [36].

            </section>

            <section>
                A further design goal was to accommodate potential challenges with verbal
                communication and directions <br><br>[23].
            </section>

            <section>
                Tasks and task steps function as a nonverbal and explicit set

            <section>
                They also provide the user with visual aides,
                giving managers the ability to attach images and video for each task step to assist with

            <section>User Interface Design</section>

            <section>The user interface design of the application was guided by available research on the
                topic of effective guidelines when designing for autistic users, combined with how
                these guidelines could be adapted to meet the prospective goals of Wayfinder
                application users.
            </section>

            <section>Icons, Colors, and General User Interface Choices:</section>

            <section>Throughout the application neutral color palettes were chosen to accommodate color sensitive users.
                <br><br>[40], [39]
            </section>
            <section>Simple icons and images were implemented across the application to reinforce the concepts and
                actions
                that they represented. <br><br> [40]
            </section>
            <section>
                The interface was also designed to minimize the amount of content on the screen at any given time in
                order
                to minimize cognitive burden. [40]
            </section>

            <section>The application’s navigation was designed to be as simple and
                consistent as possible, with each page clearly conveying to the user where they
                currently are in the application.
            </section>

            <section>File System UI <br><br>The primary user interface was modeled after the file
                systems present in modern operating systems. The design was intended to be familiar
                to users and simple to navigate. <br><br> [42], [43]
            </section>

            <section>Additionally, the folder directory functionality has the ability to perform a weighted
                search for any of the mentioned functionality. This is also intended to be
                a familiar style of interface, as most web users rely on searches to navigate.
            </section>

            <section>The application name of Wayfinder, the application icon, and the writing
                tone used throughout the application, were chosen with the intention of expressing a
                sense of inclusion and acceptance.
                <br>
                <br>
                Inspired by Polynesian wayfinding explorers, the hope is that the
                Wayfinder application conveys to the user that it is here to help you find
                the way. <br><br>[44], [45]
            </section>


        </section>

        <section>
            <section>Conclusion</section>

            <section>
                The primary research goal of the Wayfinder project was to illuminate how software
                design and user experience design can take autistic differences into consideration and
                provide possible interventions.
            </section>

            <section>
                This project also highlights some of the higher goals in the use of such technology, such as active inclusion, promoting diversity, and tools for continued
                support for autistic adults.
            </section>
            <section>
                The intention is that tools such as these would be a cost-effective path of least resistance, leading to
                workplace buy-in and, hopefully, increased autistic hiring and long-term retention.
